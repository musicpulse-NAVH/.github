## MusicPulse

MusicPulse leverages web3.0 technologies to facilitate the monetization (recurring revenue through subscriptions) and resale of IPs. Use cases of such a mechanism include music, datasets for fine-tuning AI models, and software. 

Creators have full ownership and custody of the IPs that they develop. Built with ERC6551, on-chain subscription model makes it easy to have a transparent and verifiable valuation of IPs. The platform facilitates the trustless transfer of IPs and the enforcement of royalty payments. The original creator is entitled to a certain percentage of royalty payments for all secondary sales.
